Carte 

Carte is an innovative digital menu and ordering platform built for restaurants. Unlike most restaurant technology providers, Carteâ€™s rich feature set is built intentionally with the diner in mind, improving their experience and reducing order friction.

My role as a software engineer was to create the user's register and login page, user dashboard, and the site analytics. I was required to handle all the coding required to create tables and store procedures in the backend to the frontend using Javascript to create the UI. 
Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my resposibilities.

- Engineered and styled user login and register interface using React.Js from the backend to the frontend. 
- Developed proper authentication and authorization methods for user login in .NET Core using BCrypt validation and salt/hashed passwords for encryption and validation     against database.
- Created the required tables and store procedures in SQL utilizing foreign keys, unique constraints, joins, and exception handling.
- Utilized Git and GitHub as source control to ensure proper workflow and maintain code quality and continuity throughout the development process. 
- Developed API controllers, interfaces, and services in .NET Core to capture HTTP requests in RESTful API syntax and relay user submissions to the database. 
- Utilized GitBash and Github to maintain a proper workflow
- Created new branches to keep work organized and apart from main
- Performed commits and pull requests to secure consistency and quality. 
- Participated with team members to conduct daily stand-ups, code talks, and code reviews to ensure proper coding standards/conventions were being followed. 
- Created components in React to better debug and read code functionality.
